# Python 2 Web Scraping Section
<hr>
There are several files for several attempts to scrape info:
<li>scraping_demo.py is the code from Eric Darsow's demonstration the night of class.
<li>newegg_scrape.py scrapes a graphics card page on the site Newegg.com and attempts to output the results into a CSV. It currently is generating "IndexError: list index out of range" 
<li>The "horror" scrape.py files are a scrape using the demo code on goodreads.com of horror titles. I had wanted to generate titles, ratings, and authors, but was unable to implement it exactly.
<li>jswart_blog_scrape.py scrapes a blog, www.coreyms.com, and takes the article titles, summary, and link to the video on youtube and outputs into text and an organized CSV.
