### Week 1 homework: Generate a personal icon
<hr>
This assignment was to take 10x10 binary representation of a personal icon and create a program to display it a non-binary format (similar to ASCII).  
Additional options were to flip the icon, invert it, and allow for both resizing and rotating the icon from user prompted input.  

An additional option was to send the output to a file of some form with a text file suggested.
  
As of due date I was only able to display the icon, invert, and flip it.

Original assignment was updated 10 April, 2020 with additional comments as I was able to add text file output with a user-created variable filename. A default filename is possible if no user input is entered.
