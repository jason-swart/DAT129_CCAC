# Python 2 Final Project
Following the limited documentation for pulling from the Eventful.com API, the code pulls concert venues for a location (Pittsburgh in this instance) and saves the data in a variable. 
  
This project is a continuation of the API section, pulling venues from the Eventful.com API and putting results into a CSV.
I had trouble with the JSON array in trying to sort the keys and values as the idea was to pull venue names, genre, and popularity to insert in either a database or CSV and use numpy to visualize the results as which venues by genre were the most popular in Pittsburgh (or whichever location was chosen). The idea was to tie this into a previous final project from DAT 102 that determined the "metal quality" of either Pittsburgh, PA or Cleveland, OH.
<li> This is unfinished and still needs to be sorted properly.
